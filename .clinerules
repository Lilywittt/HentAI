# Coding Standards

## File Encoding
- **Python Scripts**: Always explicitly use `encoding='utf-8'` when opening files for reading or writing (e.g., `open(filename, 'r', encoding='utf-8')`).
- **Source Files**: Ensure all generated source code files are saved with UTF-8 encoding.
- **Output**: When scripts output text to stdout/stderr, ensure they handle UTF-8 characters correctly, especially on Windows.
